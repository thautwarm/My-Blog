## `__match__` protocol is weak, inefficient and difficult to use.


Let me firstly introduce an alternative `__match__` protocol.

- (RULE: no args)`match v: case C()` matches, if
   
  `bool(C.__match__(v, 0, ())) is True`.

- (RULE: only positional args)`match v: case C(a1, a2, ..., an)` matches, if

  `C.__match__(v, n, ())` matches a tuple pattern `(a1, ..., an)`.

- (RULE: only keyword args)`match v: case C(k1=kp1, ..., kn=kpn)` matches, if

  `C.__match__(v, 0, ('k1', ..., 'kn'))` matches a tuple pattern `(kp1, ..., kpn)`.

- (RULE: positional + keyword)`match v: case C(a1, ..., am, k1=kp1, ..., kn=kpn)` matches, if

  `C.__match__(v, m, ('k1', ..., 'kn'))` matches a tuple pattern `(a1, ..., am, kp1, ..., kpn)`




### Weakness of Current `__match__`

The PEP says, `InRange` shall be made with custom patterns.

After reading the PEP, I got to know how to implement this:

```python
class Check:
    def __init__(self, f):
        self.f = f
    def __eq__(self, o):
        return self.f(o)

class InRangeProxy:
    def __init__(self, lo_check, hi_check):
        self.lo_check, self.hi_check = lo_check, hi_check
    
class InRange:
    __match_args__ = ['lo_check', 'hi_check']

    def __init__(self, lo, hi):
        self.lo, self.hi = lo, hi
    
    def __match__(self, instance):
        return InRangeProxy(
            Check(lambda lo: lo <= instance),
            Check(lambda hi: instance < hi)
        )

match 5:
    case InRange(0, 10):
        ...
```





## Comments about the rejection of AND (&) patterns

This can be extremely useful when working with custom patterns.

```python
match value:
    case P1(a, b) and P2(c) when pred(a, b, c):
        ...
```

`P1` and `P2` here may be custom patterns, each of which destructs the data with
one perspective, and extract something we'd use latter.

This can be very frequent in the real world, say we're working with URL strings,
assume that we've implemented some small patterns like `Urlsplit` and `Urlopen`,
which respectively uses `urllib.parse.urlsplit` and `urllib.request.urlopen`
and presents destructed results:

```python
match url:
    case Urlsplit(netloc=n) and Urlopen(code=c)
        if c == 404 and n == "docs.python.org":
        ...
```

Without AND patterns, we cannot reuse the existing patterns like
`Urlsplit` or `Urlopen`. This disables the composability/modularity of programs.

By providing AND patterns, it becomes feasible for us to decouple our codes by implementing small patterns.
The users can reuse our patterns by combining them with AND patterns and OR patterns, even if we don't know how our code will get used.
