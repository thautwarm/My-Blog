My Projects Used Widely
================================

- GeneralizedGenerated.jl: A library greatly enhances staged programming of Julia
    - https://github.com/thautwarm/GeneralizedGenerated.jl

- MLStyle.jl: A library provides advanced functional programming infrastructures(like, extensible pattern matching) for Julia
    - https://github.com/thautwarm/MLStyle.jl

- graphviz-artist: A library provides a higher level APIs for Graphviz in Python
    -  https://github.com/thautwarm/graphviz-artist


My Other Projects With Great Personal Efforts Prospective Values
=============================================================================

- `<RBNF.hs https://github.com/thautwarm/RBNF.hs>`_: An advance based on LL(k) parsing,
    but equipped with several extensions like left recursion resolutions(yes, for LL parsing),
    grammar inlining(without causing reduction conflicts),
    more advanced syntax-driven features,
    context-sensitive stuffs like predicates according to global/local contexts,
    lookahead optimizations based on decision trees.
    The time complexity can regress to linear without using context-sensitive stuffs.
- `<FSTan  https://github.com/thautwarm/FSTan>`_ : A F# library providing a more usable light-weighted higher-kinded types.
- `<RSolve.hs https://github.com/thautwarm/RSolve>`_ : A Haskell library providing easy-to-use monadic interfaces for constraint solvers, bundled with examples like HM unifications.
- `<RSolve.py https://github.com/thautwarm/rsolve.py>`_ : A Python library providing easy-to-use and intuitive OOP interfaces for constraint solvers, bundled with examples like HM unifications.
- `<Idris-Cam https://github.com/thautwarm/idris-cam>`_ :
    An abstract codegen backend for Idris programming language, bundled with backend implementations in Python and Julia.
    The Python implementation: https://github.com/thautwarm/idris-python.

- `<restrain-jit https://github.com/thautwarm/restrain-jit>` : A more available JIT compilation for CPython.
- `<moshmosh https://github.com/thautwarm/moshmosh> ` :
    The Python syntax extensions, bundled with the fastest implementation of pattern matching in Python world,
    according to the benchmark, at least more than 4 times faster than the Pampy project. Besides, unlike Pampy,
    moshmosh won't introduce lots of APIs or lead to a steep learning curve.

- `<do-you-like-wan-you-si https://github.com/thautwarm/do-you-like-wan-you-si`_ : Automatically playing Fate/Grand Order.

- `<CanonicalTraits.jl https://github.com/thautwarm/CanonicalTraits.jl>` : Traits/Typeclasses implemented in Julia.

- `<HigherKindedPolymorphisms.jl https://github.com/thautwarm/HigherKindedPolymorphisms.jl>`_ : Higher kinded types for Julia(light-weighted higher-kinded polymorphisms).
